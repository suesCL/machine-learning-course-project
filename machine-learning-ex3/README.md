# Handwritten Digits Recognition 

## Overview 
* Neural Network 
  * Model representation 
  * Feedforward Propagation and Prediction 
  
## Neural Network 
### Problem Statement 

The project is to implement a neural network to recognize handwritten digits. 
Neural network is a more suitable suitable algoritm than logistic regression to predict handwirtten digits 
because it can represent complex models based on non-linear hypothesis. The code utilized parameters from a neural network that researches have already 
trained and implements a feedforward propagation algorithm for prediction.

### Implementation 
* **Model representation**
