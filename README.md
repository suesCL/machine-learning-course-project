# Machine Learning Project
The project contains common machine learning algorithms and its application to solve real world problems. I developed the functions and modules to solve machine learning problems.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Overview
* Linear regression 
* Logistic regression
* Logistic classificaion
* Neural network
* Methods on model validation and visualization

## How to Install
Install Octave to run octave script 
Run the main file **ex.m** which uses functions in seperate files
