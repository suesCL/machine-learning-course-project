# machine-learning-course-project
This project contains all code for exercise project from machine learning course at Coursera. 
Each exercise has a pdf that explains what it is. Each exercise is for practicing coding machine learning algorithm such as linear regression, logistic regression, logistic classificaion, neural netowrk. It helps better understand how algorithm works. 
Some exercises also shows how to train and cross validate models and visualize the training process. 

How to Install: 
Install Octave to run octave script 
Run the main file **ex.m** which uses functions in seperate file
