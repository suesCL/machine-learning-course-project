# Anomaly and Recommendation Systems 

## Anomaly detection

## Recommendation Systems
Recommendation system utilizes a collaborative filtering to predict movie ratings for movies that users have not rated. "Collaborative filtering makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences information from many users (collaborating)."

### Movie ratings dataset 
The input data is matrix Y which stores the ratings 1 to 5 with each element a rating from a user on a movie. The matrix R is a binary valued indicator matrix where R(i,j) = 1 means user j gives a rating on movie i and R(i,j) = 0 means user j gives no rating on movie i. 
The purpose of collaborative filtering is to predict rating where R(i,j) = 0.

X and Theta are the parameters to be learned. The i-th row of X corresponds to a feature vector x^(i) for the i-th movie and the j-th row of theta corresponds to one parameter vector for the j-th user. Both x^i and Î˜^j are n-dimensional vectors.

### Collaborative filtering learning algorithm
The model predicts the rating for movie i by user j as shown in ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26426412/33539163-cd55c360-d879-11e7-9bd4-0d055e94feb7.png).

* Gradient:


The collaborative filtering gradient is made of X_grad and Theta_grad. X_grad is a matrix of the same size as X and Theta_grad 
has the same size as Theta.
